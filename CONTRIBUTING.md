# Overview
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! This set of basic guidelines will help us make `state-transition` development as easy, effective and transparent as possible for everyone involved.
In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Issues
### Bug reports
Before reporting a bug please use the Github search and check if the issue has already been reported/fixed.

A great bug report should include: 
- Short summary of problem
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Background context -- platform, version of the lib and everything that you think may be important to reproduce and fix the newfound bug.

Make sure to use the bug report template available when creating a new issue.

### Feature requests
Please provide as many details and as much context as possible. Use the feature request template available when reporting a new issue.

## Pull requests
Every pull request description should include the number of the issue it's resolving. Usually this looks like "Closes #<>" text in the PR description.

Pull requests with new features, bug fixes and improvements are very helpful and should remain focused on one main thing and avoid containing unrelated commits.
Please stick to the coding conventions used throughout the project (indentation, code-style, accurate comments, etc.).

## Code style

* All code-style settings are consolidated in the `Codestyle.dotsettings` file. 
  * If you're working in JB Rider IDE, then just import this `dotsettings` file using the `Preference Layers` tool window.  

## Collaborating guidelines

The main rule for now is that every PR requires at least two approvals from the `state-transition` lib team members, unless it's a small fix (like a typo). Usually by approve we mean commment "LGTM" in the PR.

Note that this set of rules can (and should) be extended in the future.  
Feel free to discuss and propose improvements to this guidelines!
